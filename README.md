Renewable Energy Resource Analysis Documents

This repository contains python code and notebooks that I have used to analyze renewable energy resource data and create persentation visualizations for engineering reports. The original data was provided in both month long time series data recording vertical column velocity as well as 2-D site transects providing instantaneous cross section data of tidal currents.
